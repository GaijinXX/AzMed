# Design Document

## Overview

The recent searches dropdown feature will enhance the search experience by providing quick access to previously searched terms. The implementation will integrate seamlessly with the existing SearchBar component and leverage localStorage for persistence.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
SearchBar (existing)
├── RecentSearchesDropdown (new)
│   ├── RecentSearchItem (new)
│   └── ClearAllButton (new)
└── useRecentSearches (new hook)
```

### Data Flow
1. User performs search → Search term saved to localStorage via hook
2. User focuses search input → Hook retrieves recent searches from localStorage
3. User selects recent search → Search term populated and search triggered
4. User deletes recent search → Item removed from localStorage and UI updated

## Components and Interfaces

### useRecentSearches Hook
```typescript
interface RecentSearchesHook {
  recentSearches: string[]
  addRecentSearch: (searchTerm: string) => void
  removeRecentSearch: (searchTerm: string) => void
  clearAllRecentSearches: () => void
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Manage localStorage operations for recent searches
- Maintain maximum of 5 unique search terms
- Handle deduplication (move existing terms to top)
- Provide methods for adding, removing, and clearing searches

### RecentSearchesDropdown Component
```typescript
interface RecentSearchesDropdownProps {
  isVisible: boolean
  recentSearches: string[]
  onSelectSearch: (searchTerm: string) => void
  onRemoveSearch: (searchTerm: string) => void
  onClearAll: () => void
  onClose: () => void
}
```**Resp
onsibilities:**
- Render dropdown with recent search items
- Handle keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- Manage dropdown visibility and positioning
- Provide accessible ARIA attributes

### RecentSearchItem Component
```typescript
interface RecentSearchItemProps {
  searchTerm: string
  isSelected: boolean
  onSelect: () => void
  onRemove: () => void
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Display individual search term
- Show delete button on hover
- Handle click and keyboard interactions
- Apply selected state styling

## Data Models

### Recent Searches Storage
```typescript
interface RecentSearchesStorage {
  key: 'recent-searches'
  value: string[] // Array of search terms, max 5 items
}
```

**Storage Rules:**
- Maximum 5 unique search terms
- Most recent searches appear first
- Duplicate searches move to top of list
- Empty/whitespace-only searches are ignored
- Searches longer than 100 characters are truncated

## Error Handling

### localStorage Errors
- **Quota exceeded**: Gracefully handle by clearing oldest searches
- **Access denied**: Fall back to in-memory storage for session
- **Parse errors**: Reset to empty array and log error

### Component Errors
- **Invalid search terms**: Filter out null/undefined values
- **Keyboard navigation**: Prevent index out of bounds errors
- **Focus management**: Ensure proper focus restoration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- useRecentSearches hook functionality
- localStorage operations and error handling
- Component rendering and interactions
- Keyboard navigation behavior

### Integration Tests
- SearchBar integration with dropdown
- Multi-language support
- Persistence across page reloads
- Accessibility compliance

### E2E Tests
- Complete user workflow: search → save → recall
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Cross-browser localStorage behavior## Imple

### SearchBar Integration
The existing SearchBar component will be enhanced to:
- Show/hide dropdown based on focus and recent searches availability
- Handle keyboard navigation between input and dropdown
- Manage dropdown positioning relative to search input
- Integrate with existing search functionality

### Styling Approach
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Follow existing design system patterns
- Ensure dropdown doesn't interfere with other UI elements
- Support both light and dark themes
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### Performance Considerations
- Debounce localStorage writes to prevent excessive I/O
- Use React.memo for RecentSearchItem to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement virtual scrolling if search history grows beyond 5 items (future)
- Lazy load dropdown content only when needed

### Accessibility Features
- ARIA roles and labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, Enter, Escape, Tab)
- Focus management and restoration
- High contrast mode support
- Screen reader announcements for search selection

### Multi-language Support
- Integrate with existing translation system
- Translate dropdown labels and buttons
- Preserve original language of search terms
- Handle RTL languages properly

### Browser Compatibility
- localStorage feature detection
- Fallback to sessionStorage if localStorage unavailable
- Cross-browser keyboard event handling
- Mobile touch interaction support
