# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds multi-language support to the Azerbaijan drug database application by implementing a language selector component. Users will be able to switch between Azeri, Russian, and English languages, with English as the default. The language selector will follow the same design pattern as the existing theme selector dropdown menu to maintain UI consistency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select my preferred language from a dropdown menu, so that I can view the application interface in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display the language selector with English as the default selected language
2. WHEN I click on the language selector THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown with three options: "English", "Azeri", and "Russian"
3. WHEN I select a language from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL immediately update all UI text to the selected language
4. WHEN I select a language THEN the system SHALL persist my language preference for future sessions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language selector to have consistent styling with the theme selector, so that the interface feels cohesive and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the language selector THEN the system SHALL use the same visual design patterns as the theme selector dropdown
2. WHEN the language selector is displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing, colors, and typography with the theme selector
3. WHEN hovering over language options THEN the system SHALL provide the same hover effects as the theme selector
4. WHEN the dropdown is open THEN the system SHALL use the same animation and positioning behavior as the theme selector

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interface text to be translated when I change languages, so that I can fully understand and use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select Azeri THEN the system SHALL display all UI text in Azeri language
2. WHEN I select Russian THEN the system SHALL display all UI text in Russian language  
3. WHEN I select English THEN the system SHALL display all UI text in English language
4. IF a translation is missing for a specific text THEN the system SHALL fall back to English text
5. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL update text for search placeholders, button labels, table headers, and all other UI elements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my language preference to be remembered across browser sessions, so that I don't have to reselect my language every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a language THEN the system SHALL store my preference in localStorage
2. WHEN I return to the application THEN the system SHALL automatically load my previously selected language
3. IF no language preference is stored THEN the system SHALL default to English
4. WHEN clearing browser data THEN the system SHALL reset to English as the default language

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the language system to be easily maintainable and extensible, so that new translations can be added efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing translations THEN the system SHALL use a centralized translation management approach
2. WHEN adding new translatable text THEN the system SHALL require minimal code changes across components
3. WHEN adding a new language THEN the system SHALL support easy integration without major refactoring
4. WHEN managing translations THEN the system SHALL organize translation keys in a logical, hierarchical structure
