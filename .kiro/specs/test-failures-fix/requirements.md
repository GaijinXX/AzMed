# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing test failures in GitHub Actions that prevent successful deployment to GitHub Pages. The failures include ES module import issues, missing browser APIs in test environment, and missing React imports. This feature will systematically resolve all test failures to ensure reliable CI/CD deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass in the CI environment, so that the application can be successfully deployed to GitHub Pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in GitHub Actions THEN all ES module import errors SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN tests execute THEN no "require() of ES Module" errors SHALL occur
3. WHEN the test suite completes THEN the build process SHALL succeed without test failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want browser APIs to be properly mocked in tests, so that performance monitoring code doesn't break the test suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN PerformanceObserver SHALL be properly mocked or conditionally used
2. WHEN performance utilities are imported THEN they SHALL not cause ReferenceError in test environment
3. WHEN browser-specific APIs are used THEN they SHALL have appropriate fallbacks for Node.js test environment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React imports to be consistent across all components, so that no "React is not defined" errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN App.jsx is rendered THEN React SHALL be properly imported and available
2. WHEN any component uses JSX THEN React SHALL be in scope
3. WHEN tests render components THEN no React reference errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test configuration to handle both CommonJS and ES modules correctly, so that import/export statements work consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files import utilities THEN both dynamic imports and static imports SHALL work
2. WHEN ES modules are used THEN the test environment SHALL support them properly
3. WHEN legacy CommonJS requires are used THEN they SHALL be converted to proper ES imports
