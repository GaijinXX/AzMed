# Test Suite Stabilization Requirements

## Introduction

The Azerbaijan Drug Database application currently has significant test failures (49 failed out of 608 tests) that need to be addressed to ensure application stability and reliability. The main issues include app initialization errors, URL state management problems, and inconsistent mocking strategies across test files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Initialization Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to initialize properly in test environments so that UI components are rendered correctly and tests can interact with them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is rendered in a test environment THEN it SHALL display the normal UI components (search bar, table, pagination) instead of error states
2. WHEN the application encounters initialization errors THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery mechanisms
3. WHEN mocked services are used in tests THEN they SHALL return consistent, valid responses that allow normal app flow
4. WHEN the app initializes THEN it SHALL NOT throw unhandled exceptions that cause the entire component tree to render error boundaries

### Requirement 2: URL State Management Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want URL state management to work consistently so that bookmarks, sharing, and browser navigation function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN URL parameters are parsed THEN they SHALL be correctly decoded and applied to application state
2. WHEN application state changes THEN the URL SHALL be updated to reflect the new state
3. WHEN invalid URL parameters are encountered THEN they SHALL be gracefully handled with fallback to default values
4. WHEN browser navigation (back/forward) occurs THEN the application state SHALL sync correctly with the URL
5. WHEN default values are used THEN they SHALL be omitted from the URL to keep URLs clean

### Requirement 3: Test Environment Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test environments so that tests are reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are mocked THEN they SHALL provide realistic responses that match production behavior
2. WHEN components are tested THEN they SHALL have access to all required dependencies and contexts
3. WHEN async operations are tested THEN they SHALL be properly awaited and handled
4. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN they SHALL simulate realistic error conditions

### Requirement 4: Error Handling Robustness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully so that I can continue using the app even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the application SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN URL parsing fails THEN the application SHALL fall back to default state
3. WHEN component rendering fails THEN error boundaries SHALL catch errors and provide recovery options
4. WHEN performance monitoring fails THEN it SHALL NOT crash the application

### Requirement 5: Performance Monitoring Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring to work reliably in all environments so that it doesn't interfere with application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance monitoring is initialized THEN it SHALL check for browser environment availability
2. WHEN window object is not available (Node.js/test environment) THEN performance monitoring SHALL gracefully degrade
3. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL NOT cause memory leaks or performance issues
4. WHEN performance monitoring encounters errors THEN it SHALL log them without crashing the application

### Requirement 6: Component Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive integration tests so that I can ensure components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are tested together THEN they SHALL communicate properly through props and context
2. WHEN user interactions are simulated THEN they SHALL trigger the expected state changes and side effects
3. WHEN data flows through the application THEN it SHALL be transformed and displayed correctly
4. WHEN edge cases are encountered THEN the application SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 7: Mock Service Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable mock services so that tests can simulate various scenarios consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search operations are mocked THEN they SHALL return data in the expected format
2. WHEN error conditions are simulated THEN they SHALL provide realistic error objects
3. WHEN async operations are mocked THEN they SHALL resolve/reject appropriately
4. WHEN service dependencies change THEN mocks SHALL be updated to match

### Requirement 8: Browser Environment Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work correctly across different environments so that it's accessible to everyone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in a browser THEN it SHALL have access to all required browser APIs
2. WHEN the application runs in a test environment THEN it SHALL gracefully handle missing browser APIs
3. WHEN browser-specific features are used THEN they SHALL be feature-detected before use
4. WHEN polyfills are needed THEN they SHALL be provided for test environments

### Requirement 9: State Synchronization Accuracy

**User Story:** As a user, I want application state to stay synchronized across all components so that the UI remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN URL state changes THEN all dependent components SHALL update accordingly
2. WHEN local state changes THEN it SHALL be reflected in the URL when appropriate
3. WHEN multiple state updates occur THEN they SHALL be batched for performance
4. WHEN state conflicts arise THEN there SHALL be a clear resolution strategy

### Requirement 10: Test Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can confidently make changes to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical user flows are tested THEN they SHALL have end-to-end test coverage
2. WHEN edge cases are identified THEN they SHALL have specific test cases
3. WHEN bugs are fixed THEN they SHALL have regression tests to prevent reoccurrence
4. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL include comprehensive tests
