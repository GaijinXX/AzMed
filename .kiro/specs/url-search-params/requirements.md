# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables URL-based search functionality that allows users to bookmark, share, and directly access specific search results with all search parameters (search terms, pagination, sorting, filters) preserved in the URL. Users can navigate directly to a URL and see the exact search state they expect, improving the overall user experience and making the application more shareable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want search terms to be reflected in the URL, so that I can bookmark and share specific search results with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters search terms THEN the URL SHALL update to include the search query as a parameter
2. WHEN a user navigates to a URL with search parameters THEN the search input SHALL be populated with the search terms from the URL
3. WHEN a user clears the search input THEN the search parameter SHALL be removed from the URL
4. WHEN a user shares a URL with search parameters THEN other users SHALL see the same search results when accessing that URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want pagination state to be preserved in the URL, so that I can bookmark specific pages of search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a different page THEN the URL SHALL update to include the current page number
2. WHEN a user navigates to a URL with a page parameter THEN the application SHALL display the specified page
3. WHEN a user is on page 1 THEN the page parameter SHALL be omitted from the URL for cleaner URLs
4. IF a user navigates to an invalid page number THEN the application SHALL redirect to page 1 and update the URL accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want sorting preferences to be maintained in the URL, so that shared links preserve the sort order I've selected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sorts by a column THEN the URL SHALL include sort field and direction parameters
2. WHEN a user navigates to a URL with sort parameters THEN the table SHALL display data sorted according to those parameters
3. WHEN a user removes sorting (returns to default) THEN the sort parameters SHALL be removed from the URL
4. IF a user navigates to a URL with invalid sort parameters THEN the application SHALL use default sorting and update the URL

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want column visibility settings to be preserved in the URL, so that customized table views can be shared and bookmarked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes column visibility THEN the URL SHALL update to reflect the visible columns
2. WHEN a user navigates to a URL with column parameters THEN the table SHALL display only the specified columns
3. WHEN all columns are visible (default state) THEN the column parameter SHALL be omitted from the URL
4. IF a user navigates to a URL with invalid column parameters THEN the application SHALL show default columns and update the URL

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the browser's back and forward buttons to work correctly with search states, so that I can navigate through my search history naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the browser back button THEN the application SHALL restore the previous search state from the URL
2. WHEN a user clicks the browser forward button THEN the application SHALL restore the next search state from the URL
3. WHEN the URL changes due to browser navigation THEN all UI components SHALL update to reflect the new state
4. WHEN a user performs multiple search actions THEN each state change SHALL create a new browser history entry

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clean and readable URLs that are easy to understand and share, so that the URLs remain user-friendly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parameters have default values THEN those parameters SHALL be omitted from the URL
2. WHEN the URL contains parameters THEN they SHALL use clear, descriptive parameter names
3. WHEN multiple parameters are present THEN they SHALL be properly encoded and formatted
4. WHEN a user manually edits URL parameters THEN the application SHALL handle invalid values gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want URL state management to be performant and not cause unnecessary re-renders, so that the application remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN URL parameters change THEN only affected components SHALL re-render
2. WHEN the same search state is applied multiple times THEN duplicate API calls SHALL be prevented
3. WHEN URL parsing occurs THEN it SHALL not block the UI thread
4. WHEN invalid parameters are detected THEN error handling SHALL not impact application performance
