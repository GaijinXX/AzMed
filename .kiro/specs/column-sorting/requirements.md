# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds interactive column sorting functionality to the existing Azerbaijan Drug Database table. Users will be able to click on column headers to sort the table data by that column, with visual indicators showing which column is currently being sorted and in which direction (ascending or descending). Clicking on the same column header will toggle the sort direction, providing an intuitive way to organize and analyze the pharmaceutical data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the drug database table, I want to click on column headers to sort the data by that column, so that I can organize the information in a way that helps me find and compare drugs more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any sortable column header THEN the system SHALL sort the table data by that column in ascending order by default
2. WHEN a user clicks on a column header that is already being used for sorting THEN the system SHALL toggle the sort direction between ascending and descending
3. WHEN sorting is applied THEN the system SHALL send the sort parameters to the backend API for server-side sorting
4. WHEN the API call is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading state while maintaining the current table data
5. WHEN new sorted data is received THEN the system SHALL update the table display with the sorted results
6. WHEN sorting is changed THEN the system SHALL reset pagination to the first page
7. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and maintain the previous sort state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear visual indicators showing which column is currently being sorted and in which direction, so that I can understand how the data is organized and make informed decisions about further sorting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a column is being used for sorting THEN the system SHALL display a sort indicator (arrow) next to the column header text
2. WHEN sorting is in ascending order THEN the system SHALL show an upward-pointing arrow (↑) or equivalent icon
3. WHEN sorting is in descending order THEN the system SHALL show a downward-pointing arrow (↓) or equivalent icon
4. WHEN no sorting is applied to a column THEN the system SHALL show no sort indicator for that column
5. WHEN hovering over a sortable column header THEN the system SHALL show a visual indication that the column is clickable (cursor change, hover effect)
6. WHEN only one column can be sorted at a time THEN the system SHALL remove sort indicators from other columns when a new column is selected for sorting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sorting functionality to work seamlessly with existing features like search and pagination, so that I can combine these tools to efficiently navigate and analyze the drug database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sorting is applied and a search is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain the sort order for the search results
2. WHEN sorting is applied and pagination is used THEN the system SHALL maintain the sort order across all pages
3. WHEN the page size is changed THEN the system SHALL maintain the current sort order
4. WHEN the column selector is used to hide/show columns THEN the system SHALL maintain the current sort state if the sorted column is still visible
5. IF the currently sorted column is hidden via column selector THEN the system SHALL reset to no sorting
6. WHEN the table is loading due to sorting THEN the system SHALL disable other interactive elements to prevent conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want appropriate columns to be sortable based on their data types, so that the sorting behavior makes sense and provides meaningful organization of the pharmaceutical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing text columns (product_name, active_ingredients, manufacturer) THEN the system SHALL sort alphabetically (A-Z ascending, Z-A descending)
2. WHEN viewing numeric columns (number, wholesale_price, retail_price) THEN the system SHALL sort numerically (lowest to highest ascending, highest to lowest descending)
3. WHEN viewing date columns (date) THEN the system SHALL sort chronologically (oldest to newest ascending, newest to oldest descending)
4. WHEN viewing mixed content columns (dosage_amount, amount) THEN the system SHALL sort alphanumerically with numbers taking precedence
5. WHEN a column contains null or empty values THEN the system SHALL place these values at the end of the sort order regardless of direction
6. IF certain columns should not be sortable THEN the system SHALL not show hover effects or clickable behavior for those headers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sorting functionality to be accessible and work well on different devices, so that I can use this feature regardless of my device or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL allow users to focus on column headers and activate sorting with Enter or Space keys
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL announce the current sort state and direction when sorting changes
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain sorting functionality with touch-friendly column headers
4. WHEN column headers are too narrow for sort indicators THEN the system SHALL ensure indicators are still visible and don't overlap with text
5. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL ensure sort indicators are clearly visible
6. WHEN sorting is loading THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA live region announcements for screen readers
